Sure, here is a detailed and complete solution with the required inclusions:

Problem Description (LeetCode problem 1):

"Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order."

Constraints:
- 2 <= nums.length <= 10^3
- -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
- -10^9 <= target <= 10^9
- Only one valid answer exists.

Approach:
We can solve this problem using a hash map. 
Traverse the input array, for each element subtract it from the target, and check whether the result exist previously in the hash map or not. If it exists, return the index of the current element and the index of the result in the map. If it doesn't exist, add the current element and its index to the map.

Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the nums list. We are just iterating over the list once.
Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the nums list. In worst case, we might have to store all the numbers in the hash map.

Let's implement this in code now.

```python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    """
    :type nums: List[int]
    :type target: int
    :rtype: List[int]
    """
    num_map = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        diff = target - num
        if diff in num_map:  # if diff exists in hashmap
            return [num_map[diff], i]
        num_map[num] = i  # if num does not exist in map then add it

    # if no solution found, return empty array (shouldn't happen according to problem constraints)
    return []
```
Example test cases: 

```python
print(twoSum([2,7,11,15], 9))  # Output: [0, 1]
print(twoSum([3,2,4], 6))  # Output: [1, 2]
print(twoSum([3,3], 6))  # Output: [0, 1]
```
