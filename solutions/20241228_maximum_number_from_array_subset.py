Here's a Python solution using the sort function with a custom comparison function:

'''
Problem Description:
Given an array of positive integers, find the maximum possible integer you can create by concatenating the numbers in a subset of the array.

Solution Approach:
We approach this problem by sorting the array of numbers in a specific way. Instead of comparing the numbers themselves, we compare their string representations. This is due to the fact that concatenating larger numbers does not always result in a larger number overall. 
We then concatenate all numbers in the sorted array to get our maximum possible number.

Complexity Analysis:
- Time: O(n log n), due to the sorting of the array. Each comparison in the sort takes constant time.
- Space: O(n), due to the space required to store the string representation of the numbers.

'''

def getMaxNumber(arr):
    """
    Function to get maximum possible integer by concatenating numbers in a subset of the array
    Args: arr: List[int] : array of positive integers
    Returns: str : maximum possible integer
    """
    # If the array is empty, return 0
    if not arr:
        return '0'
    # Convert all numbers in the list to strings 
    arr = [str(x) for x in arr]
    # Sort the array in reverse order using custom comparator
    arr.sort(cmp=lambda x, y: cmp(y+x, x+y), reverse=True)
    # Concatenate all numbers in the sorted array to get the maximum possible number
    maxNum = ''.join(arr)
    return maxNum
'''
If you face ImportError for cmp in Python3, use functools with sort() function
Replace the sort line with the following:
arr.sort(key=functools.cmp_to_key(lambda x, y: int(y+x) - int(x+y)))
You need to import functools at the start of the code
